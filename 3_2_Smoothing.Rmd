## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
data("polls_2008")
qplot(day, margin, data = polls_2008)
```

```{r - # bin smoothers}

span <- 7 
fit <- with(polls_2008,ksmooth(day, margin, x.points = day, kernel="box", bandwidth =span))
polls_2008 %>% mutate(smooth = fit$y) %>%
    ggplot(aes(day, margin)) +
    geom_point(size = 3, alpha = .5, color = "grey") + 
    geom_line(aes(day, smooth), color="red")


```


```{r - # kernel}

span <- 7
fit <- with(polls_2008, ksmooth(day, margin,  x.points = day, kernel="normal", bandwidth = span))
polls_2008 %>% mutate(smooth = fit$y) %>%
  ggplot(aes(day, margin)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = .5, color = "grey") + 
  geom_line(aes(day, smooth), color="red")
```

```{r}
polls_2008 %>% ggplot(aes(day, margin)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(color="red", span = 0.15, method = "loess", method.args = list(degree=1))
```
