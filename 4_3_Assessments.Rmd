## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
library(dslabs)
library(caret)
library(tidyverse)
data("tissue_gene_expression")
      
# set.seed(1993) #if using R 3.5 or earlier
set.seed(1993, sample.kind="Rounding") # if using R 3.6 or later
ind <- which(tissue_gene_expression$y %in% c("cerebellum", "hippocampus"))
y <- droplevels(tissue_gene_expression$y[ind])
x <- tissue_gene_expression$x[ind, ]
x <- x[, sample(ncol(x), 10)]

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
fit_lda <- train(x, y, method = "lda")
fit_lda$results["Accuracy"]
```

```{r}
library(dslabs)      
library(caret)
data("tissue_gene_expression")
      
set.seed(1993) #set.seed(1993, sample.kind="Rounding") if using R 3.6 or later
ind <- which(tissue_gene_expression$y %in% c("cerebellum", "hippocampus"))
y <- droplevels(tissue_gene_expression$y[ind])
x <- tissue_gene_expression$x[ind, ]
x <- x[, sample(ncol(x), 10)]
```
