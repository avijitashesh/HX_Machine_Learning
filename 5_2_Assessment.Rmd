## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(caret)
library(dslabs)
set.seed(1991)
data("tissue_gene_expression")
    
fit <- with(tissue_gene_expression, 
                train(x, y, method = "rpart",
                      tuneGrid = data.frame(cp = seq(0, 0.1, 0.01))))
    
ggplot(fit)
```


```{r}

fit_rpart <- with(tissue_gene_expression, 
                      train(x, y, method = "rpart",
                            tuneGrid = data.frame(cp = seq(0, 0.10, 0.01)),
                            control = rpart.control(minsplit = 0)))
ggplot(fit_rpart)
confusionMatrix(fit_rpart)
```


```{r}

                train(x, y, method = "rf", 
                      nodesize = 1,
                      tuneGrid = data.frame(mtry = seq(50, 200, 25))))
    
ggplot(fit)
```
